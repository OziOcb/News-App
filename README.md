## Info

This was the first time when I used Nuxt.js and Tailwind Css, I must admit that they're both cool.

Unfortunately, because the API provider ([newsapi.org](http://newsapi.org/)) has changed its free service to only allow API calls locally, the live version doesn't fetch the data (well for some reason it works on firefox only). That's why you will have to clone the repo and **run it locally**.

Here's the link to the live version - [https://newslive-co-uk.netlify.app/](https://newslive-co-uk.netlify.app/)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
